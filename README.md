## What it does

AdvocateMCP turns every local business into an AI-ready agent. One MCP endpoint, ten tools:

**Discovery (open, no auth):**

- `search_businesses` — search by category, name, or location
- `query_business_agent` — ask a specific business's AI agent for citation-ready answers
- `get_availability` — 30-min slot windows derived from business hours
- `get_quote` — exact / range / estimate-labelled pricing
- `get_credentials` — self-reported licenses, insurance, bonding, certifications
- `get_cancellation_policy` — verbatim cancellation/refund/no-show policy

**Transactional (per-tenant Bearer; agent-to-agent):**

- `reserve_slot` — 15-min HELD reservation, returns signed confirmation token
- `initiate_handoff` — SMS/email a human or mint a signed continuation URL for another agent
- `request_callback` — push user contact to the business with idempotency key
- `subscribe_to_updates` — double-opt-in email subscription (CAN-SPAM/GDPR)

All ten carry MCP-spec annotations: `title`, `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `openWorldHint`. Every outbound link is HMAC-SHA256-signed for end-to-end attribution.

## Quick start (Claude Desktop)

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "advocate": {
      "url": "https://api.advocatemcp.com/mcp",
      "transport": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Try:

- *"Find me a marketing agency in Austin"*
- *"What does the top-rated email-marketing agency in my area charge for a 4-email welcome sequence?"*
- *"When is a law firm with 5-star reviews available Thursday afternoon?"*
- *"Is the locksmith on 5th Avenue licensed and insured?"*

## How it works (also a bot interceptor)

Beyond the central MCP server, AdvocateMCP runs at the edge on each registered business's domain. A Cloudflare Worker sits in front of the site, detects AI crawler user-agents (PerplexityBot, GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Googlebot, etc.), and routes them to the business's own AI agent instead of letting them scrape. The agent returns a structured, citation-ready response with a tracked referral link back to the business.

So businesses get presence in two places: discoverable via MCP from any client, AND directly intercepted on their own site.

## Architecture

- **Edge:** Cloudflare Worker (TypeScript, strict mode) deployed via wrangler — `customers.advocatemcp.com`
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express on Railway — `api.advocatemcp.com`
- **Databases:** SQLite for analytics + business data; Cloudflare D1 for portal auth + edge data; KV namespace `BUSINESS_MAP` for domain → slug routing
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), prompt caching enabled
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0); SSE retained for backward-compat but not advertised
- **Rate limiting:** 60 req/min per IP via Cloudflare Durable Object; per-agent tier ceilings (unverified=100, known=250, trusted=1000)
